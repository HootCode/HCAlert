# HCAlert

HCAlert - iOS System-like popup with tech hideable section

* Generate iOS System-like popup with exactly the same UI
* Insert hideable UITextView to show some technical informations, useful to share with devs team
* Respect 2/more UI buttons
* Has its own pool for HCAlerts (no-need to worry about multiple in-screen & stacked popup)

## Todo

* Refractored code
* Add simple interface (2 methods only)
* Dynamically add sections (ie add/remove the textview, add/remove buttons, label... etc)
* Add rules on HCAlert pool, ie priority for each HCAlertView (Minor, Normal, Prior, Critic)
* More ...
